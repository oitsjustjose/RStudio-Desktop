# RStudio Desktop

An electron wrapper for RStudio Cloud with dark mode support, knitting support and more.

"Why would I use this?" you may ask - that's a perfectly reasonable question. Well, if you're like me and don't have or want to waste 7GB just to knit a PDF file, then you'd resort to [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). Unfortunately, there are a few customizations to it that I feel are pretty important to be able to make, and are not possible without using JS and a custom browser extension.
